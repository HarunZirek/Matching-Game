# MatchingGame
This is my matching game with 10 unique levels for my personal school project.

I had limited time for doing this project. So i made it like a demo. It has nine different stages with a power up testing stage. All of the materials and codes are saved as prefabs and reusable. That's makes it take a very short time to add new stages.
